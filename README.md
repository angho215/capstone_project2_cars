**Problem Statement:**
  "How to increase sales revenue by 10% by utilizing market price prediction model to identify good price point in order to generate more online sales in coming six months?"
  There are many factors that impact on used cars price. To increase the selling price, it is good to identify the factors that have high impact on and correlation with price. The goal of this project is to use statistical inference and predictive analysis to explore if predictions of price can be made related to some factors such as the age of used cars, the exterior features and mechanical features of cars etc.  

**Proposed Solution:**
  Perform exploratory analysis and predictive modeling from Craigslist Used Cars dataset.     
Accurate predictive models can help us in general to identify market trend and niche market price as well as benefit us on increasing revenue.

**Correlations**
  The study suggests that used cars have features such as it is a pick up cars with 6- 8 cylinder and sell in West, it can be priced higher price. 
  It further suggests that age and mileages are the main factors in deciding the market price but other features also play important roles such as the brand, type and location etc.

**Recommendations:**
1. Specializing our used cars such as pick up and truck type of car dealer.

2. Identify good buy back deal on American brand cars from Northeast and Midwest regions since they both have reasonable average listing price compare to other region and resell them to other region such as Central which generally has the higher reseller price.

3. We should utilize tiered pricing on different type of cars depend on location, number of cylinders and their condition since these elements have direct impact on the pricing when we put our cars in the market. We also should avoid buy back any vehicles in fair condition.

4. Remote Sales: Since we are sourcing used car national wide, we can provide additional research service and remote sales to our customers (not limited to the local search).

**Can be studied further in the future:**
1. how to improve the prediction: gather more data from different sources such as different websites to improve the prediction accuracy. 
2. Can income or population impact on the price: the income and population data can take into the consider and analyzing further the relationship between them and the price.
